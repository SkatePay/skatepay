The skatepark, located at 600-620 W. Channel St., was built by a group of skateboarders in the early 2000s, though was never permitted for operation. Regardless, the park became a well-known destination amongst the skateboarding community, often being featured in skating videos of renowned professional skaters and locals alike.",
